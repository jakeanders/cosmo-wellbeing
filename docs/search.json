    "section": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption it caused had substantial short-term effects on young people’s lives around the world, with evidence of significant impacts on young people’s wellbeing and mental health (De France et al., 2022; Wolf & Schmitz, 2024). Young people in England, the focus of this paper, were no exception: extended periods in which in-person schooling was suspended (Anders, 2024) interrupted both pupils’ learning (Jakubowski et al., 2024) and their social lives (Kalenkoski & Pabilonia, 2024), with consequent rises in loneliness a clear symptom of this (Kung et al., 2023). This widespread disruption had widely documented short-term effects on young people’s wellbeing (e.g. Attwood & Jarrold, 2023; Banks & Xu, 2020; Neugebauer et al., 2023; Newlove-Delgado et al., 2021; Quintana-Domeque & Zeng, 2023), the magnitude of which was found to be linked with the intensity of lockdown restrictions (Owens et al., 2022), and the immediacy of which is reflected in the way that wellbeing increased and decreased as restrictions tightened and eased (Creswell et al., 2021). A review by Kauhanen et al. (2023) summarised the international picture as “a longitudinal deterioration in symptoms for different mental health outcomes especially for adolescents and young people”.\nExisting analyses suggest that effects of the disruption were unequal, often exacerbating existing demographic inequalities in society. Previous studies from across the world have highlighted inequalities associated with socioeconomic status (e.g., Ravens-Sieberer et al., 2022), gender (e.g., Anders et al., 2023; Davillas & Jones, 2021), ethnicity (e.g., Proto & Quintana-Domeque, 2021), and intersections of these characteristics. There is also evidence that older adolescents were particularly affected (Wolf & Schmitz, 2024), perhaps as these are such formative years in terms of social relationships and critical years in terms of disruption to education affecting subsequent educational and school-to-work transitions.\nA range of studies have also drawn attention to the importance of variation in experiences and support during the pandemic for young people’s wellbeing. Restrictions on social activities and the closure of schools reduced physical activity for some, which has been linked to worse mental health outcomes (Samji et al., 2022); other aspects of the pandemic and its restrictions are likely to have exacerbated the prevalence of adverse life events that previous studies have shown affect wellbeing (Cleland et al., 2016). On the other side of the ledger, the importance of social support has been identified has a potential buffer to negative impacts (Racine et al., 2021) of such negative stressors. These highlight the potential importance of experiences and social support during the pandemic for young people’s wellbeing and, hence, the need to consider these in understanding differences in wellbeing.\nWhile short-term impacts are, of course, important in their own right, we should be especially concerned if the impacts of the pandemic are continuing to affect young people’s lives, including their subjective wellbeing, now that restrictions have subsided and life is back to ‘normal’. Concern was expressed from early in the pandemic that negative effects of the pandemic on wellbeing would persist beyond the end of restrictions (Sonuga-Barke & Fearon, 2021), something that emerging evidence from the general population suggests may be being borne out (Quintana-Domeque & Proto, 2022).\nInformed by the findings of these studies, we seek to provide new evidence regarding ongoing differences in young people’s wellbeing post-pandemic, including those driven by their demographic characteristics, the role of adverse life experiences during the pandemic, and the potential buffering role of social support. In doing so, we are guided by sociological theoretical models of stress processes in shaping wellbeing (Pearlin, 1989), distinguishing between long-term stressors such as those linked with socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, and more acute ones such as those presented by the disruption of the pandemic and specific events during its course. We also seek to provide new evidence to illuminate the relevance of young people’s own perceptions of the ongoing impacts of the pandemic for their mental wellbeing through quantifying the extent to which young people’s self-reports of such impacts are associated with their post-pandemic subjective wellbeing.\nIn particular, our research aims are to: 1. estimate differences in post-pandemic wellbeing among this cohort by demographic characteristics; 2. validate and quantify young people’s own perceptions of the impact of the pandemic on their wellbeing and; 3. consider the role of adverse experiences during the pandemic — and how they may interact with existing predictors of wellbeing — in explaining differences in post-pandemic wellbeing.\nTo achieve these aims, we use data from the COVID Social Mobility & Opportunities study (COSMO) — a representative cohort study of over 13,000 young people in England aged 14-15 at pandemic onset whose education and post-16 transitions were acutely affected by the pandemic’s disruption through their remaining education and subsequent transitions — to explore young people’s subjective wellbeing since the end of most restrictions linked to the pandemic. COSMO has collected data on wellbeing at two annual, post-pandemic surveys (to date), along with rich data on demographics, social resources and experiences during the pandemic, allowing us to explore post-pandemic patterns in wellbeing and how they are shaped by these factors.\nThe paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data that we use in more detail, the steps we take to prepare it for analysis, and conduct descriptive analyses and visualisation to provide initial evidence on our research aims. In Section 3, we describe our use of regression modelling to support our analyses, before presenting results of this modelling in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude with a discussion of our findings and their implications for policy and practice."

    "section": "2 Data and descriptive analyses",
    "text": "2 Data and descriptive analyses\nThis study uses data from the COVID Social Mobility & Opportunities study (COSMO). This longitudinal cohort study recruited a representative sample of young people (and their parents) who were in Year 10 (i.e., aged 14-15) at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. We use data from those who participated at both waves 1 (Anders et al., 2024a), which was carried out between October 2021 and March 2022 (while participants were aged 16-17), and 2 (Anders et al., 2024b), which was carried out between October 2022 and March 2023 (while participants were aged 17-18). In both cases the majority of interviews are carried out within the first two months of fieldwork; we also control for month of interview in our regression models (further details below).\nCOSMO has a clustered and stratified design with oversampling of those from smaller (e.g., ethnic minorities), more disadvantaged and harder to reach demographic groups, aiming to allow for larger than proportional samples of those smaller groups to improve statistical power when exploring inequalities between such groups. Furthermore, there was initial non-response and attrition between the two waves. As such, it is important to take into account the deliberate and modelled disproportionalities in our sample, as well as the implications of the clustering and stratification for statistical inference; we seek to take these features into account in all our analyses using R’s survey package (Lumley et al., 2024) with the study’s provided clustering and stratification variables, and design and non-response weights (Adali et al., 2022, 2023).\nTo ensure a consistent sample across analyses, we restrict the sample to those who have valid data on the key variables we will be using in our analyses. This includes the primary outcome variable of self-reported wellbeing score, as well as the key predictors and demographic variables of which we make use. However, we are mindful of the potential implications of sample selection caused by complete case analysis, so we robustness check our results to ensure that our findings are not driven by the exclusion of those with missing data in Section 7, re-running our core analyses having only restricted the sample based on the primary outcome (wellbeing score) and the main predictors (impact of pandemic on mental health and adverse life events reporting) and multiply imputed across 10 datasets all other predictors using a highly flexible classification and regression tree approach (Lumley, 2019; van Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2023).\n\n2.1 Subjective wellbeing\nTo measure self-reported wellbeing, we use the UK Office for National Statistics’ official measure of life satisfaction (Office for National Statistics, 2018), which is widely recognised as an important dimension of subjective wellbeing (Petersen et al., 2022). This asks participants to respond to the prompt “Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?” on a scale ranging from 0 “Not at all satisfied” to 10 “Completely satisfied”. This measure has been used in national UK surveys since 2011 and increasing numbers of academic studies, hence providing a useful benchmark for this concept in surveys based in the UK. There is also evidence that this measure is reliable measure of subjective wellbeing in young people (Levin & Currie, 2014), performing as well as the more in-depth Satisfaction with Life Scale (Jovanović, 2016), for example, although we do recognise that it will not capture all dimension of wellbeing (Ruggeri et al., 2020). It is also worth noting that, while they are distinct constructs, a clear correlation between lower wellbeing and increased risk of poor mental health (Lombardo et al., 2018).\nAs COSMO was established in response to the pandemic, there are no baseline pre-pandemic measures. As such, we emphasise that our estimates of differences in subjective wellbeing are between individuals all of whom have experienced the pandemic, but may have experienced it in different ways, rather than between their current situation and a counterfactual in which the pandemic did not happen. Others have used pre-existing longitudinal studies to explore change in mental health across the pandemic period (Henseke, mimeo), or attempted to get closer to such a counterfactual using a survey experiment approach explicitly asking participants to imagine the scenario where the pandemic had not happened (Andreoli et al., 2024).\nWe have measures of wellbeing at two waves post-pandemic and use these to explore evidence of change in wellbeing between the two waves both overall, and between sub-groups of the data where this might be expected. We plot the overall distribution of reported wellbeing in both Waves 1 (age 16/17) and 2 (age 17/18) in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Histogram of distribution of subjective wellbeing in Wave 1 and 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: Histogram weighted for survey design and non-response.\n\n\n\nYoung people report a mean wellbeing score of 6.41 in Wave 1 and 6.43 at Wave 2, with the spread of the measure declining slightly from 2.05 to 1.97, but these are not a particularly substantial change. This provides little evidence of change between these two post-pandemic time points. However, in attempting to interpreting this (lack of) aggregate change, we must be mindful of wider context for this cohort.\nOne interpretation would be that, as we know there was a decline in mental health and wellbeing among young people at the onset of the pandemic and its restrictions (Newlove-Delgado et al., 2021), we would hope to see an upward trajectory in wellbeing in subsequent years to be confident of a ‘bounce back’, with this lack of change suggesting a plateau at a lower level than was the case before the pandemic. That could be the case. A finding of minimal change is consistent with the findings of Henseke et al. (2022) (albeit for a wider age range of young people aged 16-29). Similarly, the UK Office For National Statistics’ annual population survey also suggests that life satisfaction has not returned to pre-pandemic levels in the general population (Office for National Statistics, 2023).\nFundamentally, using our data alone we are unable to adjudicate between multiple potential plausible scenarios. Others, using a wider range of datasets are better placed to do so. For example, Henseke (mimeo) suggest that young people’s wellbeing may have already returned to pre-pandemic levels, thus explaining a lack of trend for this reason. These findings would also be consistent with an upward post-pandemic trend being cancelled out by a countervailing age effect (for example) that would be expected based on the wider literature on wellbeing across the life course (Blanchflower, 2021).\nHowever, this is not the focus of our paper. This aggregate stability at the cohort level does not mean that there are not individual-level differences or differential change in reported wellbeing. The correlation between the reported measures in Waves 1 and 2 is 0.54. While some of this likely reflects the natural fluctuation in young people’s wellbeing due to idiosyncratic shocks that hit their lives every day, we now go on to explore evidence of systematic difference in change between the two waves, along with the differences in levels at each wave.\n\n\n2.2 Demographic characteristics and social support\nAs discussed at the outset of this paper, previous work has found that the impact of the pandemic on young people’s wellbeing differs depending upon their demographic characteristics (e.g., Anders et al., 2023). Both to estimate differences between young people based on these characteristics, and to control for these measures in other analyses, we make use of the rich set of demographic measures collected in COSMO. Specifically, we construct the following measures of demographic characteristics.\n\nGender: There are longstanding concerns about differences in wellbeing by gender, which have only been exacerbated by the pandemic (Davillas & Jones, 2021). We construct a variable for this characterised based on young people’s reports at either wave (where a subsequent report is given precedence if they differ), young people are grouped into ‘female’, ‘male’ and ‘non-binary+’, where the final category is a combination of those who explicitly report being non-binary or choose to identify in any other way (since these other groups are too small for analysis).\nEthnicity: There is evidence of a greater initial effect on young people’s mental health if they are part of an ethnic minority (Proto & Quintana-Domeque, 2021). As with gender, our measure is based on self-reports at either wave (where a subsequent report is given precedence if they differ), young people are grouped into ‘White’, ‘Mixed’, ‘Black’, ‘Asian’ and ‘Other’. While these categories are broad, they are chosen for consistency with the UK’s major ethnic group classifications while avoiding groups that are too small for analysis purposes.\nParental education: Generally viewed as a core component of socioeconomic status, which may affect wellbeing through long-term stress processes (Pearlin, 1989), we construct a measure of parental education based on the highest level of education reported by either parent at either wave (where a subsequent report is given precedence if they differ), grouping parents into ‘Graduate’, ‘Below Graduate’ and ‘No Quals’.\nHousing tenure: Housing tenure is another component of a family’s socioeconomic status, hence with potential implications for young people’s wellbeing. We construct a measure of housing tenure based on young people’s reports at either wave (where a subsequent report is given precedence if they differ), grouping families into those who own their home (either with a mortgage or outright; ‘Own House’) and all others (which predominantly include social and private renting; ‘Other’).\nArea deprivation: We also include an area-based measure of deprivation of participants’ home address, both as a correlate of socioeconomic stats due to residential sorting and given more direct implications this can have for potentially wellbeing-enhancing amenities. COSMO provides decile groups of the UK’s Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI), which is constructed at the ‘lower-layer super-output area’ (the smallest geographical areas in UK statistical geography, containing an average population of 1,500).\n\nTo allow exploration of differences in wellbeing by socioeconomic status (SES) in a simple way, we create a combined index of SES across our measures of parental education, housing tenure and home neighbourhood deprivation. Specifically, given the categorical nature of these variables, we estimate a polychoric correlation matrix of these measures and use principal component analysis (Revelle, 2024) to extract a single component that explains maximum shared variance. Our extracted principal component score explains 65% of the overall variance of our SES measures. We standardise the measure’s distribution to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 in our analysis sample, plot its distribution in Figure 2, and use it to split our sample into five quintile groups of equal size (accounting for sample weighting).\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of SES summary measure, colour-coded by quintile group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: SES measure based on polychoric principal component analysis of parental education, housing tenure and IDACI decile group. Density plot weighted for survey design and non-response.\n\n\n\nWe demonstrate that this measure captures the underlying SES measures on which it is based in Table 1 by reporting the average levels of parental education, housing tenure and IDACI quintile group across the five quintile groups of the constructed SES measure.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Distribution of underlying socioeconomic characteristics by SES quintile group (SES quintile group based on polychoric principal component analysis of parental education, housing tenure and IDACI decile group)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\n1 (Low SES) N = 1,602\n2 N = 1,598\n3 N = 1,608\n4 N = 1,665\n5 (High SES) N = 1,519\n\n\n\n\nParental Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Graduate\n16\n41\n63\n69\n89\n\n\n    Below Graduate\n54\n52\n33\n30\n11\n\n\n    No Quals\n27\n6.3\n3.3\n1.4\n0\n\n\n    Unknown\n3.1\n0.8\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n\nHousing Tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Own House\n10\n49\n75\n90\n100\n\n\n    Other\n90\n51\n25\n9.5\n0\n\n\n    Unknown\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\nIDACI Quintile Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    1 (High Deprivation)\n76\n31\n1.8\n0\n0\n\n\n    2\n23\n43\n29\n&lt;0.1\n0\n\n\n    3\n1.1\n23\n47\n22\n0\n\n\n    4\n&lt;0.1\n3.6\n18\n60\n17\n\n\n    5 (Low Deprivation)\n0\n0.2\n3.3\n19\n83\n\n\n\nNotes: Reporting column percentages within each variable. All estimates are weighted for survey design and non-response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious reviews of the impact of the pandemic have highlighted that one’s ability to draw on support around you appears important in helping to buffer shocks to wellbeing (Aksoy et al., 2024), using these as resources on which young people are able to draw in the face of adversity. To capture this factor, we use the social provisions scale (Cutrona & Russell, 2018), specifically a shortened three-item variant available in COSMO in which young people are asked to respond (using the categories “Not true”, “Partly true” or “Very true”) to the statements:\n\nI have family and friends who help me feel safe, secure and happy\nThere is someone I trust whom I would turn to for advice if I were having problems\nThere is no one I feel close to [Negatively coded]\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Distribution of social provisions scale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: Distribution of social provisions scale. The scale is standardised to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 in the analysis sample. Weighted for survey design and non-response.\n\n\n\nFollowing standard practice, we sum over the values of the three items and then standardise the resulting variable to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one for the purposes of interpretation. We plot the distribution of the social provisions scale in Figure 3. There is some evidence of a ceiling effect — the majority of respondents scoring the maximum value of 6 on the scale — but with a decent spread below this. We will use this measure as a continuous variable in our analyses.\nNow that we have constructed this set of measures about young people, we report the prevalence of demographics in our cohort along with mean levels of self-reported wellbeing by these categories at Wave 1, Wave 2, and mean difference between the two in Table 2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Mean subjective wellbeing score by demographic characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nN\nPrevalence (%)\nWave 1\nWave 2\nDifference\n\n\n\n\nOverall\n\n\n\n\n6.41\n6.43\n0.017\n\n\n    1\n7723\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Male\n3475\n50\n6.76\n6.76\n0.007\n\n\n    Female\n4030\n48\n6.13\n6.15\n0.021\n\n\n    Non-Binary+\n218\n2.6\n4.90\n5.04\n0.136\n\n\nEthnicity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    White\n4877\n77\n6.43\n6.44\n0.014\n\n\n    Mixed\n477\n5.7\n6.09\n6.09\n-0.008\n\n\n    Black\n1503\n10\n6.51\n6.48\n-0.030\n\n\n    Asian\n684\n5.0\n6.34\n6.43\n0.094\n\n\n    Other\n182\n2.2\n6.44\n6.64\n0.201\n\n\nParental Education\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Graduate\n3807\n55\n6.48\n6.45\n-0.024\n\n\n    Below Graduate\n2962\n36\n6.35\n6.37\n0.024\n\n\n    No Quals\n871\n7.6\n6.25\n6.54\n0.286\n\n\n    Unknown\n83\n0.8\n6.42\n6.37\n-0.049\n\n\nHousing Tenure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Own House\n4224\n65\n6.50\n6.54\n0.037\n\n\n    Other\n3499\n35\n6.24\n6.22\n-0.020\n\n\n    Unknown\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIDACI Quintile Group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    1 (High Deprivation)\n2306\n22\n6.24\n6.23\n-0.007\n\n\n    2\n1678\n19\n6.39\n6.42\n0.032\n\n\n    3\n1351\n19\n6.34\n6.46\n0.118\n\n\n    4\n1231\n20\n6.54\n6.56\n0.023\n\n\n    5 (Low Deprivation)\n1157\n20\n6.56\n6.49\n-0.072\n\n\nSES Quintile Groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    1 (Low SES)\n2257\n20\n6.26\n6.26\n0.005\n\n\n    2\n1770\n20\n6.28\n6.37\n0.088\n\n\n    3\n1405\n20\n6.42\n6.40\n-0.019\n\n\n    4\n1266\n21\n6.53\n6.53\n0.006\n\n\n    5 (High SES)\n1025\n19\n6.58\n6.58\n0.002\n\n\n\nNotes: Reporting means where otherwise specified. All estimates are weighted and account for the complex survey design. The difference is calculated as Wave 2 - Wave 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n50% of the sample are male, 48% are female and 2.6% are non-binary or report in another way. Average reported wellbeing differs substantially between these groups with boys (6.76 in Wave 1) reporting higher levels of wellbeing than girls (6.13). This is consistent with existing work on inequalities in young people’s wellbeing, both before the pandemic and as a result of its impact. Non-binary+ young people report lower levels of wellbeing still than girls, although there is evidence of an increase for this group between Waves 1 and 2; we should be mindful, however, of the smaller sample size for this group.\nIn terms of ethnicity, the highest levels of reported wellbeing are for Black young people (6.51 in Wave 1), followed by White young people (6.43), with the lowest being among young people who reported a Mixed ethnicity. These differences are small and, other than the small group of young people placed into the Other category, there is little evidence of change over time.\nThere is a broadly consistent gradient in wellbeing across our quintile groups of socioeconomic status, from 6.26 to 6.58 (both for Wave 1 but with a similar picture in Wave 2). Again, these appear to be rather small differences and there is no evidence of consistent change between the two waves.\nOverall, this initial analysis highlights gender as the most important demographic difference in wellbeing for this sample of young people in England. However, we will return to explore these differences in more detail, including their potential interplay, in later sections.\n\n\n2.3 Perceived ongoing impact\nNext, we seek to quantify differences in young people’s wellbeing by their own perceptions of the ongoing impact of the pandemic. This takes seriously young people’s own perceptions of the ongoing impact of the pandemic on their wellbeing. To capture these perceptions, we use a question asked to young people at the second wave of COSMO. Specifically, young people are asked “Would you say the pandemic is still having an effect on [your mental wellbeing], whether positive or negative?” If they agree with this question then they are subsequently asked to distinguish whether this impact is positive, negative or they don’t know.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Mean subjective wellbeing score by whether and how the pandemic continues to affect mental wellbeing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Variable, N = 7723\n      No (64%)1\n      Negative (32%)1\n      Don’t know (2%)1\n      Positive (2%)1\n      Overall (100%)1\n      p-value2\n    \n  \n  \n    Wave 1\n6.81\n5.62\n6.37\n6.40\n6.41\n&lt;0.001\n    Wave 2\n6.91\n5.46\n6.29\n6.48\n6.43\n&lt;0.001\n    Difference\n0.11\n-0.16\n-0.08\n0.08\n0.02\n&lt;0.001\n  \n  \n    \n      Notes: All estimates are weighted and account for the complex survey design.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, much smaller proportion of young people report that the ongoing impact is positive (2%) or that they don’t know if the impact is positive or negative (2%).\nThose who report no impact of the pandemic on their mental wellbeing have the highest self-reported wellbeing (6.37 in Wave 1; 6.29 in Wave 2), while those who report that it had a negative impact on their mental wellbeing report the lowest (5.62 in Wave 1; 5.46 in Wave 2). Those who say it is still having an impact but that it is positive, or that they don’t know if it is positive or negative, report somewhere between the other two groups but, as noted above, these are a very small proportion of the sample.\nThese groups are also distinguished by the change in their reported wellbeing between Waves 1 and 2. Those who report that the pandemic is continuing to have a negative impact on their mental wellbeing do, indeed, report a decline in wellbeing (-0.16) between the two waves, while those who report that it has had no impact (-0.08) or that it is having a positive impact report an increase (0.08). Those who report that it is still having an impact but that they don’t know if it is positive or negative report a slight decline (0.11).\nThese last two groups are small, so these estimates should be treated with caution, and in subsequent analyses we decide to combine these two groups with the group who report no impact. This allows for an overall comparison of those who report an ongoing negative impact with the rest of the sample in our later regression analyses seeking to understand the interplay of these perceptions further.\n\n\n2.4 Adverse life events\nFinally, we are interested in understanding whether subjective wellbeing is affected by adverse life events that happened during the COVID pandemic. In Wave 1, COSMO asked participants whether they had experienced each of the following life events since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020:\n\nA parent/guardian or carer lost their job or business\nMy family could not afford to buy enough food, or had to use a food bank\nMy family could not afford to pay their bills/rent/mortgage\nI was seriously ill in hospital\nA close family member or friend is or was seriously ill in hospital\nA close family member or friend died\nIncrease in number of arguments with parents/guardians\nIncrease in number of arguments between parents/guardians\nMoving to a new home\nParents/guardians separated or divorced\n\nThe question is worded to capture events whether or not they are directly attributable to the pandemic, its restrictions and disruptions, but it is reasonable to believe many were caused or exacerbated by the circumstances of the pandemic. Participants were then asked again whether they had experienced these events over the past twelve months (i.e., for most participants a year since they responded to the Wave 1 survey) in Wave 2.\n29% of pupils experience no events at all, while 26% experience three or more events. We report the proportion of young people experiencing each of the ten specific adverse life events in the first column of Table 4.\nWe initially anticipated using the simple count of number of adverse events experienced in analyses. However, the substantial differences in prevalence of the events means this would be inappropriately imposing the same importance, or severity, of all the events. Instead, we want to allow these to differ, such that lower probability/higher impact events are given more weight in our analysis. We therefore create a composite index of adverse life events using a polychoric principal component analysis (PCA) of the ten measured adverse life events.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Distribution of Adverse Events Index, colour-coded by tertile group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: Adverse events index based on polychoric principal component analysis of measured adverse life events. The index is standardised to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 in the analysis sample. Weighted for survey design and non-response.\n\n\n\nThe first principal component explains 32% of the variance in the ten adverse life events. We standardise this index to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1 in our analysis sample, plot the distribution in Figure 4, and use it to split it into three groups based on the tertiles of the index (accounting for sample weighting). We label these groups as “Low”, “Medium” and “High” to reflect the relative impact of adverse events experienced by each of these groups.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Adverse life events experiences by Adverse Events Index group\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Variable, N = 7723\n      Low (36%)1\n      Medium (30%)1\n      High (33%)1\n      Overall (100%)1\n    \n  \n  \n    Parent lost job\n0\n13\n23\n12\n    Couldn't afford food\n0\n2.8\n23\n8.4\n    Couldn't afford bills\n0\n4.6\n28\n11\n    Seriously ill\n0\n2.6\n7.0\n3.1\n    Close family member seriously ill\n0\n45\n54\n32\n    Close family member died\n19\n28\n51\n33\n    More arguments with parents\n0\n28\n72\n32\n    More arguments between parents\n0\n7.8\n60\n22\n    Moved home\n0\n6.6\n16\n7.3\n    Parents separated\n0\n1.5\n10\n3.8\n    Number of events (grouped)\n\n\n\n\n        0\n81\n0\n0\n29\n        1\n19\n60\n0\n25\n        2\n0\n40\n23\n20\n        3+\n0\n0\n77\n26\n    Number of events (mean)\n0.19\n1.40\n3.44\n1.64\n  \n  \n    \n      Notes: All estimates are weighted and account for the complex survey design.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1 %; Mean\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe report the prevalence of each of the ten adverse life events by the three groups of the index in Table 4. This demonstrates that these groups are capturing different levels of exposure to adverse life events, while reflecting the differential prevalence of the ten events. Students in the “Low” group are likely not to have experienced any of the events, with the exception of a close family member dying. In contrast, students in the “High” group have a good chance of having experienced multiple events.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5: Mean subjective wellbeing score by experience of adverse life events reported since onset of pandemic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Variable, N = 7723\n      Low (36%)1\n      Medium (30%)1\n      High (33%)1\n      Overall (100%)1\n      p-value2\n    \n  \n  \n    Wave 1\n7.04\n6.46\n5.67\n6.41\n&lt;0.001\n    Wave 2\n7.02\n6.47\n5.75\n6.43\n&lt;0.001\n    Difference\n-0.03\n0.00\n0.08\n0.02\n0.2\n  \n  \n    \n      Notes: All estimates are weighted and account for the complex survey design.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Mean\n    \n    \n      2 Design-based KruskalWallis test\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe find that mean wellbeing score differs by experience of such events (Table 5). Wellbeing is lower for those who experience a higher prevalence of adverse life events, ranging from 5.67 for those with low experience of adverse life events to 6.46 for those with a high level of experience of these. This pattern is consistent across Waves 1 and 2, but there is no significant evidence of difference in the patterns of change over time.\nHowever, as with all our descriptive analyses, we are mindful that there is the potential for a lot of differences in socioeconomic and demographic characteristics between those who experience adverse life events and those who do not. For this reason, as well as for our other analyses, we use regression models to help us unpack these findings further."

    "section": "3 Regression analysis",
    "text": "3 Regression analysis\nTo extend our descriptive analyses and, hence, provide a more nuanced understanding of the factors associated with young people’s wellbeing since the pandemic, we use regression models. All analyses are carried out using the statistical software R (R Core Team, 2024), with the survey package (Lumley et al., 2024) used to account for the complex survey design of the data, including design and non-response weights, along with adjustments to statistical inference due to stratification and clustering of the sample.\nWe break this section into three sub-sections, aligned with the research aims in this paper for which we will use regression modelling to support our analysis: demographic differences in subjective wellbeing; the importance of perceived ongoing impact of the pandemic; and the importance of adverse life events during the pandemic.\n\n3.1 Demographic differences in subjective wellbeing\nFirst, we use linear regression models to explore differences in young people’s wellbeing. These models all take the form\n\\(LifeSat_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta'_{1} SES_{i} + \\beta'_{2} Gender_{i} + \\beta'_{3} Ethnicity_{i} + X'_{i} + \\varepsilon_{it}\\)\nwhere \\(LifeSat\\) is the wellbeing score for person \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\), \\(SES\\) is a vector of binary variables for the quintile groups of SES (leaving the highest SES quintile group as the omitted category), \\(Gender\\) is a vector of binary variables for gender variables (Female and Non-binary+, leaving Male as the omitted category), \\(Ethnicity\\) is a vector of binary variables for ethnicity (White, Asian, Black, Mixed, Other, leaving the omitted category as Mixed), \\(X\\) is a vector of other covariates, which varies between model specifications (discussed further below), and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is the error term. We estimate these models separately for each time point of the survey, and then again for Wave 2 with an additional covariate of Wave 1 wellbeing score to provide estimates of difference adjusting for Wave 1 wellbeing as a baseline.\nWe begin with simple models including gender (L1), ethnicity (L2), and SES (L3) entered separately, replicating the descriptive analyses and unconditional estimates of differences in wellbeing reported in Table 2. Next, we include all three demographic characteristics at the same time in L4, along with the addition of a month of interview variable to allow for potential confounding due to the timing of the survey. This model, hence, provides estimates of demographic differences in wellbeing, conditional on the other demographic characteristics included.\nWe then explore evidence of intersectional differences in wellbeing between our core demographics in L5 (Codiroli Mcmaster & Cook, 2019) by including a full set of interaction terms between our SES, gender and ethnicity variables.\nNext, motivated by understanding the potential importance of social resources in explaining these differences, we add social provisions score in L6. Differences between the coefficients on our demographic characteristics between L4 and L6 will, hence, provide information on the extent to which differences in these resources may explain the unadjusted differences.\nL7 explores whether the importance of social resources varies by demographic characteristics. As with L5, we include interaction terms, this time between our demographic characteristics and the two social resources measures to allow for the moderation of the relationship between these measures and wellbeing.\nFinally, L8 explores the importance of adverse life events in explaining demographic differences in wellbeing. We include the adverse life events index in this model, along with the demographic characteristics and social resources measures. Comparing coefficients on the demographic characteristics in L6 and L8 will, hence, provide information on the extent to which differences in adverse life events may explain demographic differences in wellbeing. We do not run a model exploring the interaction between adverse life events and demographic characteristics at this point as we will explore this in a subsequent section.\n\n\n3.2 Importance of perceived impact of the pandemic on wellbeing\nIn this section, we again use linear regression models to estimate differences in subjective wellbeing. However, this time we focus on differences explained by young people’s perceptions of the ongoing impact of the pandemic on their life, allowing us to validate and quantify these reports. The models used for this purpose all take the form:\n\\(LifeSat_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta'_{1} PandemicImpactPercep_{i} + X'_{i} + \\varepsilon_{it}\\)\nwhere \\(LifeSat\\) is the wellbeing score for person \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\), \\(PandemicImpactPercep\\) is a binary variable indicating that person \\(i\\) reports that the pandemic is continuing to have a negative impact on their life, \\(X\\) is a vector of other covariates, which varies between model specifications (discussed further below), and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is the error term. We estimate these models separately for each time point of the survey, and then again for Wave 2 with an additional covariate of Wave 1 wellbeing to provide estimates of difference adjusting for Wave 1 wellbeing as a baseline.\nOur first model (P1) again replicates our descriptive findings by including no additional covariates, meaning the coefficient on \\(PandemicImpactPercep\\) reports the difference between those who report that the pandemic had a negative impact on their mental wellbeing and the rest of the cohort (no longer disaggregating the ‘don’t know’ and ‘positive’ groups).\nNext, in P2, we include demographic (gender, ethnicity) and socioeconomic status (parental education, housing tenure, and area-level deprivation) covariates. We do this, rather than including combined SES quintile groups, now that we are not trying to interpret an overall SES association but rather adjust for these as flexibly as possible. We also include month of survey at this point. Our focal coefficient from this model thus estimates the difference in wellbeing associated with a continuing negative perception of the pandemic on wellbeing among those with similar socio-demographic characteristics.\nWe then explore the extent to which differences in wellbeing associated with a negative perceived impact of the pandemic are explained by the social resources available to young people. In P3, we add social provisions score and compare the estimate on our focal variable coefficient between models P2 and P3.\nFinally, in P4, we explore evidence of variation in the difference in wellbeing associated with a negative perceived impact of the pandemic by demographic and social support measures. We do this by including a full set of interaction terms between our focal variable and the socio-demographic and social support variables in P3. Examining the coefficients on these interaction terms will provide evidence on this point.\n\n\n3.3 Importance of adverse life events during the pandemic\nFor the paper’s final research aim, we explore the importance of adverse life events during the pandemic in explaining young people’s wellbeing post-pandemic.\nTo do so, we use linear regression models to explore the extent to which differences in self-reported wellbeing depends on the adverse life experiences they faced, including conditional on their perception of the impact of the pandemic on their wellbeing. The models used for this purpose all take the form:\n\\(LifeSat_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta'_{1} TAdverseEventIndex_{i} + X'_{i} + \\varepsilon_{it}\\)\nwhere \\(LifeSat\\) is the wellbeing score for person \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\), \\(TAdverseEventIndex\\) is a vector of binary variables indicating person \\(i\\)’s location in the distribution of the adverse life event index (high and medium, leaving low as a baseline), \\(X\\) is a vector of other covariates, which varies between model specifications (discussed further below), and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is the error term. We estimate these models separately for each time point of the survey, and then again for Wave 2 with an additional covariate of Wave 1 wellbeing to provide estimates of difference adjusting for Wave 1 wellbeing as a baseline. Where we are modelling wellbeing measured at Wave 1, a variant of our events index is used that is based on Wave 1 event reports only.\nOur first model (E1) again replicates our descriptive findings by including only the tercile groups of the adverse life events index, meaning the coefficients on each level of \\(TAdverseEventIndex\\) report the difference between those who experience medium and high levels of adverse events, as applicable, compared to the low adverse life events group. In preliminary work to inform our approach, we explored alternative ways of including information on adverse life events in our modelling, including using the index as a continuous variable and including a set of binary variables for the individual adverse life events, as listed in Section 2. We found that including tercile groups provided the most interpretable results without substantively affecting the model fit.\nNext, in E2, we add in demographic characteristics (gender, ethnicity) and socioeconomic status indicators (parental education, housing tenure, and area-level deprivation). We also include month of survey at this point. Our coefficient estimates associated with adverse life events from this model thus provides an estimate of difference in wellbeing associated with greater experiences of adverse life events during the pandemic among those with similar socio-demographic characteristics, as well as the extent to which differential distribution of such life events across socio-demographic groups explains differences in reported wellbeing.\nWe then explore the extent to which differences in wellbeing associated with greater experience of adverse life events during the pandemic are explained by the social resources available to young people. In E3, we add covariates for our social provisions scale scores and compare the estimate on our focal variable between models E2 and E3. It may be noted that this is very similar to model L6 from the earlier section but here adverse life events are our focus and, hence, are entered using the tercile groups to aide interpretation.\nNext, we include the covariate for perceived ongoing impact of the pandemic that was the focal variable of the previous section. As we hypothesise that at least some of the formation of ongoing perceptions of negative impact from the pandemic, this model (E4) is likely not a reliable guide to the association between adverse events and wellbeing since including the perception variable is over-controlling. However, the model is useful as a point of comparison with P3 in demonstrating the extent to which the difference in wellbeing associated with a negative perception of the ongoing impact of the pandemic on wellbeing is explained by having experienced adverse life events.\nFinally, analogously to previous sections, we include interactions of our focal variables (experience of adverse life events) with our socio-demographic and social support measures in model E5. This allows us to see if there is evidence of variation in the importance of having experienced adverse life events for post-pandemic wellbeing between different groups of young people."

    "section": "4 Results",
    "text": "4 Results\nIn this section, we discuss the results of the regression models outlined in the previous section. We begin by exploring demographic differences in wellbeing Section 4.1, before moving on to the importance of perceived ongoing impact of the pandemic Section 4.2 and the importance of adverse life events during the pandemic Section 4.3. We primarily report our results graphically (Larmarange, 2024), focussing attention on the estimates pertinent to addressing our research aims and allowing for easy comparison across models, supplemented with illustration of interactions between characteristics (Arel-Bundock et al., Forthcoming), where relevant. We also provide full regression tables of the results for each model, which are included in Section 6 for reference.\n\n4.1 Demographic differences in subjective wellbeing\nFirst, we explore overall differences in wellbeing, through a series of models summarised (for ease of reference) in Table 6. The core results are plotted in Figure 5 for gender, Figure 6 for ethnicity, and Figure 7 for SES. In each case, results are presented for Wave 1, Wave 2, and Wave 2 adjusted for Wave 1, with the discussion starting out with Wave 1 in each case, before focussing on any notable differences in the pattern for Wave 2, or Wave 2 adjusted for Wave 1. Full tables of results for these models are reported in Section 6, specifically Table 9 for Wave 1, Table 10 for Wave 2, and Table 11 for Wave 2 adjusted for Wave 1.\n\n\n\nTable 6: Model specifications for regression analysis of subjective wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nL1\nL2\nL3\nL4\nL5\nL6\nL7\nL8\n\n\n\n\nGender\nIncluded\n\n\nIncluded\nInteracted w/ Ethnicity and SES\nIncluded\nInteracted w/ Social Support\nIncluded\n\n\nEthnicity\n\nIncluded\n\nIncluded\nInteracted w/ Gender and SES\nIncluded\nInteracted w/ Social Support\nIncluded\n\n\nSES\n\n\nIncluded\nIncluded\nInteracted w/ Gender and Ethnicity\nIncluded\nInteracted w/ Social Support\nIncluded\n\n\nSocial Support\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluded\nInteracted w/ Gender, Ethnicity and SES\nIncluded\n\n\nAdverse Events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluded\n\n\n\nNotes: L1-L7 refer to the model number. SES = Socioeconomic status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Differences in wellbeing by gender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 2 adjusted for Wave 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: Reporting coefficients from underlying regression models reported in Table 9, Table 10, and Table 11.\n\n\n\nBeginning with gender (Figure 5), we replicate the descriptive findings (Table 2) in model L1 (except for the inclusion of controls for month of interview), finding that girls’ wellbeing is 0.63 points lower than for boys, and a larger reduction for those grouped as non-binary+ where the reduction is 1.9 points compared to boys. There is essentially no change when we adjust for ethnicity and SES in model L4, with the differences remaining 0.63 points for girls and 1.9 points for non-binary+ young people.\nHowever, some of the difference in levels of wellbeing for non-binary+ young people appears to be explained by variation in social support. When we include the social provisions scale in model L6, the difference in wellbeing reduces to 1.4 points for those identifying as non-binary+ compared to boys. This makes a similar difference for non-binary+ young people’s wellbeing at Wave 2, but no difference for girls at any wave, nor for non-binary+ youth when considering Wave 2 wellbeing after adjusting for their wellbeing at Wave 1.\nA small part of the remaining difference in wellbeing appears to be explained by experiences of adverse life events, reducing to 1.2 for non-binary+ young people and to 0.5 for girls, although the difference between models L6 and L8 is not statistically significant for the non-binary+ group, nor quite statistically significant at the 5% level for girls.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Differences in wellbeing by ethnicity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 2 adjusted for Wave 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: Reporting coefficients from underlying regression models reported in Table 9, Table 10, and Table 11.\n\n\n\nAcross Waves 1 and 2 (panels 1 and 2 of Figure 6), the only significant unconditional differences in young people’s wellbeing are between those classified as White and those classified as of Mixed ethnicity. No difference emerges when other demographic characteristics are included in model L4. However, these lower levels among those with Mixed ethnicity are explained by differences in social support, while, conversely, including this covariate reveals a significant difference in wellbeing between those classified as White and those classified as Black and Asian in model L6. This latter finding implies that if Black and Asian young people reported the same scores on the social provisions scale as White young people, their wellbeing scores would be higher. This difference is only present at Wave 2 for those with an Asian ethnicity, and is not present for any group when we are looking at Wave 2 wellbeing having adjusting for wellbeing at Wave 1.\nThe differences that emerged for Black and Asian young people in model L6 appear slightly attenuated by differences in adverse life events (0.16 for Black young people and 0.18 for Asian young people), but not by much and the estimates in L6 and L8 are not statistically significant from one another.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Differences in wellbeing by SES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 2 adjusted for Wave 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: Reporting coefficients from underlying regression models reported in Table 9, Table 10, and Table 11.\n\n\n\nThere is evidence of a gradient in wellbeing by SES, with a roughly linear pattern across SES quintile groups at both Waves 1 and 2. However, the differences are only significant in the unconditional model (L3) once we reach the top two quintile groups, compared to the bottom. The overall difference between the top and bottom quintile groups is 0.3 points at Wave 1 and a bit larger (0.33 points) at Wave 2.\nThere is essentially no difference when gender and ethnicity are included in model L4, but some of the SES gradient is attenuated by differences in social support when these are included in model L6. For Wave 1, the difference between the bottom and the second-highest quintile groups becomes statistically insignificant, although this is not the case for differences at Wave 2, given their slightly larger overall magnitude. The conditional difference between the top and bottom quintile groups is 0.21 points at Wave 1 and, again, a bit larger (0.24 points) at Wave 2.\nUltimately, even these differences between the top and bottom SES quintile groups are attenuated to statistical insignificance when we adjust for experiences of adverse life events in model L8 (although we should note that the differences in coefficients between models L6 and L8 are not themselves statistically significant). This is the case for both Waves 1 and 2, and for Wave 2 after adjusting for Wave 1 wellbeing. It would seem that, between them, we can account for much of the socioeconomic variation in wellbeing with social support and experiences of adverse life events — although it is important to note that this is not the same as saying that socioeconomic inequalities in wellbeing are unimportant, especially as socioeconomic status is likely to affect levels of social support and adverse life events.\nWe explore the potential for intersectional differences between the demographic characteristics using model L5, but find little evidence of any clear or consistent patterns of this type. Similarly, we allow for moderation of the importance of social support by demographic characteristics in model L7, but find little evidence of this either. Full tables of results for these models are reported the final two columns of Table 9 (Wave 1), Table 10 (Wave 2) and Table 11 (Wave 2 adjusting for Wave 1) in Section 6.\n\n\n4.2 Perceived continuing impact of the pandemic on wellbeing\nNext, we discuss differences in wellbeing by perceived continuing impact of the pandemic. Again, we summarise the models used to explore this issue in Table 7. The core results are plotted in Figure 8. Full tables of results for these models are reported in Section 6, Table 12 (Wave 1), Table 13 (Wave 2) and Table 14 (Wave 2 adjusting for Wave 1).\n\n\n\nTable 7: Model specifications for regression analysis of subjective wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\n\n\n\n\nPerceived Impact\nIncluded\nIncluded\nIncluded\nInteracted with Demographics, SES and Social Support\n\n\nDemographics\n\nIncluded\nIncluded\nInteracted with Perceived Impact\n\n\nSES\n\nIncluded\nIncluded\nInteracted with Perceived Impact\n\n\nSocial Support\n\n\nIncluded\nInteracted with Perceived Impact\n\n\n\nNotes: P1-P4 refer to the model number. SES = Socioeconomic status.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Differences in wellbeing by perceived continuing impact of pandemic on wellbeing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: Reporting coefficients from underlying regression models reported in Table 12, Table 13, and Table 14.\n\n\n\nResults from unconditional model P1 indicate that young people who perceive a negative continuing impact of the pandemic on their wellbeing report 1.1 points lower wellbeing score than those who do not perceive such an impact. Perhaps surprisingly, given the greater time that has elapsed since the pandemic, this difference is larger at Wave 2, with a 1.4 point difference between these two groups. However, we should recall that the report of a negative continuing impact of the pandemic is collected at Wave 2, so may reflect this being more contemporary with the report.\nA fairly small part of the difference in wellbeing score is explained by inclusion of demographic characteristics (in P2) and social support (in P3). The differences are reduced to 0.85 points and 1.2 points at Wave 1 and Wave 2, respectively, once all of these covariates have been included. This highlights a significant unexplained component of wellbeing unexplained by young people’s observable characteristics and social support — although we will return to whether more of this difference can be explained by adverse life events during the pandemic in the next section.\nThe unconditional difference in wellbeing by perceived continuing impact of the pandemic on wellbeing at Wave 2 is lower in models where we have adjusted for Wave 1 wellbeing (0.85 points). However, demographic and social support controls make essentially no difference for this outcome, with the difference remaining 0.81 points once these have been included, with a very similar magnitude to that seen in the fully adjusted model for Wave 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Predicted wellbeing by perceived ongoing impact of pandemic on wellbeing and gender\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 2 adjusted for Wave 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: Predictions derived from underlying regression models reported in Table 12, Table 13, and Table 14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Predicted wellbeing by perceived ongoing impact of pandemic on wellbeing and Social Provisions Scale Total Score\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWave 2 adjusted for Wave 1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: Predictions derived from underlying regression models reported in Table 12, Table 13, and Table 14.\n\n\n\nWe also explore whether the difference associated with this perception is moderated by key demographic characteristics, particularly focussing on gender and social provisions. The results for gender are plotted in Figure 9 and suggest that the differences in wellbeing by perceived ongoing impact of the pandemic on wellbeing are larger for boys, although this is only statistically significant at the 10% level and for Wave 1 so this is rather a tentative finding. The results for social provisions are plotted in Figure 10 and suggest little variation in the difference in wellbeing by perceived ongoing impact of the pandemic on wellbeing depending on the level of social provisions.\n\n\n4.3 Adverse life events\nNext, we turn to the importance of adverse life events for young people’s wellbeing. This is explored through a series of models that, for ease of reference, are summarised in Table 8; full results are reported in Table 15, Table 16 and Table 17 in Section 6. The core results are plotted in Figure 11, demonstrating the association unconditionally (E1), adjusting for demographic measures (E2), and adjusting also for social support (E3).\n\n\n\nTable 8: Model specifications for regression analysis of subjective wellbeing by life events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nE1\nE2\nE3\nE4\nE5\n\n\n\n\nAdverse Events\nIncluded\nIncluded\nIncluded\nIncluded\nInteracted with Demographics, SES, Social Support and Perceived Impact\n\n\nDemographics\n\nIncluded\nIncluded\nIncluded\nInteracted with Adverse Events\n\n\nSES\n\nIncluded\nIncluded\nIncluded\nInteracted with Adverse Events\n\n\nSocial Support\n\n\nIncluded\nIncluded\nInteracted with Adverse Events\n\n\nPerceived Impact\n\n\n\nIncluded\nInteracted with Adverse Events\n\n\n\nNotes: E1-E5 refer to the model number.

A small part of this difference is explained by demographic characteristics (in E2). However, more is explained by social support (in E3), especially in terms of the those who experienced the most adverse life events (i.e., the High tercile group), bringing the gap between low and high prevalence groups to 0.85 points at Wave 1 and 0.88 points at Wave 2.\nAs has become familiar, the patterns are similar but substantially attenuated when considering differences at Wave 2 that control for differences at Wave 1. Nevertheless, there remains a substantial difference (0.36 points) in wellbeing at Wave 2 by adverse events experienced even after controlling for wellbeing at Wave 1, demographic characteristics and social support.\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Differences in wellbeing by perceived ongoing negative impact of the pandemic, with and without controlling for adverse life events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes: Reporting coefficients from underlying regression models reported in Table 12, Table 13, and Table 14, and Table 15, Table 16, and Table 17.\n\n\n\nBuilding on the models reported in Figure 11, we also explore whether the association between adverse life events and wellbeing is mediated by the perceived ongoing impact of the pandemic on wellbeing. The core results are plotted in Figure 12, which compares our model including the perceived ongoing impact of the pandemic on wellbeing (E4) with the analogous model excluding our events measure from earlier analyses (P3). The results suggest that, despite the differences in perceptions explained by adverse events experienced as discussed at the start of this section, only a fairly small part of the perceived ongoing impact of the pandemic on wellbeing is explained by the experience of adverse life events during the pandemic.\nWe did also explore whether there was evidence that adverse events matter more for some groups than others using interactions between adverse life events and key demographic characteristics. These results are reported in column E5 of Table 15, Table 16 and Table 17 in Section 6. There is little evidence of any systematic moderation of the main effects that we have discussed."

    "section": "5 Conclusions",
    "text": "5 Conclusions\nThis paper contributes to existing literature on young people’s wellbeing in England in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic by exploring levels of wellbeing at two time points since the pandemic and the factors associated with these levels. In particular, we build on existing work showing that the pandemic has had a negative impact on young people’s wellbeing (e.g., Mansfield et al., 2022), along with evidence of some initial recovery in wellbeing in the latter phases of the pandemic (Henseke et al., 2022).\nWe contribute to evidence on ongoing issues of gender differences in wellbeing, which other evidence demonstrates to have been exacerbated by the pandemic (e.g., Davillas & Jones, 2021), with girls and those who identify as non-binary or in another way reporting lower wellbeing scores (on a scale from 1-10 around 0.5 for girls; around 1.5 for non-binary+ young people) than boys, even after adjusting for other demographic characteristics, self-reported levels of social support and experience of adverse life events. These are substantial differences that are relevant to the higher rates of mental health challenges for those in these groups. In particular, the large differences associated with identifying as non-binary or in another way suggest the need for targeted support for those in this group.\nOur analysis makes innovative use of young people’s own perceptions of the ongoing impact of the pandemic on their mental wellbeing in order to validate and quantify these reports. The findings of these analyses illustrate the importance of taking such reports seriously: those who indicate an ongoing negative impact in their lives have substantially lower subjective wellbeing scores — more than 1 point on a 1-10 scale — with similar differences across demographic groups.\nAdverse life events experienced during the pandemic are shown to predict lower subjective wellbeing, although they can explain only a fairly small part of the lower scores we see among those who perceive an ongoing impact of the pandemic on their mental wellbeing. Contrary to our expectations, and in contrast to others’ findings (Racine et al., 2021), while social support predicts higher wellbeing scores, we did not find evidence that it mediates or buffers the impact of adverse life events in our population.\nThis study benefits from a large, representative, longitudinal dataset, with direct reports from both young people and parents to improve the quality of data collected. Nevertheless, in drawing these conclusions, we are mindful of the limitations of this study, most particularly that our data lacks any pre-pandemic baseline measures of wellbeing, which would substantially increase our ability to understand the longer-term dynamics of the changes (or lack thereof) in wellbeing that we have observed. We should also be aware that our data is drawn from a single cohort of young people in England, whose final years in compulsory education were especially disrupted by the impacts of the pandemic, which is important context in any attempt to generalise our findings to other populations.\nOur findings indicate continuing challenges of inequalities in young people’s wellbeing and, hence, the importance of ongoing targeted support to overcome these. The practicalities of providing this at scale are now much harder for our specific cohort, since many of whom have now left education entirely, but many of the issues discussed will apply similarly to those still working their way through the education system who could be reached through schools and colleges. Ignoring this issue has potential implications for national economic performance (Deaton, 2008), including via the increased risk of mental health challenges implied (Lombardo et al., 2018), if more instrumental motivation is needed than simply the negative implications for the life experiences of these young people."
